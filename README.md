# Python 101 
This website will have basic python programs and notes.  
[Here you will find all the python programs for beginners](py1.ipynb)  
## Data types in Python
### 1- Integers: 
Integers are 32 bits long, and their range is from –2^32 to 2^32 – 1 (i.e., from –2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).  
### 2- Long Integers:  
It has unlimited precision, subject to the memory limitations of the computer.  
### 3- Floating Point Numbers:  
Floating-point numbers are also known as double-precision numbers and use 64 bits.  
### 4- Boolean:  
It can hold only one of two possible values: True or False.  
### 5- Complex Number:  
A complex number has a real and an imaginary component, both represented by float types in Python. An imaginary number is a multiple of the square root of minus one, and is denoted by j. For instance, 2+3j is a complex number, where 3 is the imaginary component and is equal to 3 × √−1.  
### 6- Strings:   
Sequences of Unicode characters.  
### 7- Lists:   
Ordered sequences of values.  
### 8- Tuples:   
Ordered, immutable sequences of values.  
### 9- Sets:   
Unordered collections of values.  
### 10- Dictionaries:   
Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
